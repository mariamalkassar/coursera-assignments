                <p>
                    Chicken is a popular option when it comes to lean protein, as it packs a considerable amount into a
                    single
                    serving without a lot of fat.

                    Plus, it’s easy to cook at home and available in most restaurants. Chicken dishes can be found on
                    just about
                    any menu, no matter what type of cuisine you’re eating.

                    But you may wonder exactly how many calories are in that chicken on your plate.

                    Chicken comes in many cuts, including breasts, thighs, wings and drumsticks. Each cut contains a
                    different
                    number of calories and a different proportion of protein to fat.

                    Here are the calorie counts for the most popular cuts of chicken.
                    Chicken breast is one of the most popular cuts of chicken. It’s high in protein and low in fat,
                    making it an
                    excellent choice for people trying to lose weight.

                    One skinless, boneless, cooked chicken breast (172 grams) has the following nutrition breakdown (1):

                    Calories: 284
                    Protein: 53.4 grams
                    Carbs: 0 grams
                    Fat: 6.2 grams
                    A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of chicken breast provides 165 calories, 31 grams of protein and 3.6
                    grams of
                    fat (1).

                    That means that approximately 80% of the calories in chicken breast come from protein, and 20% come
                    from
                    fat.

                    Keep in mind that these amounts refer to a plain chicken breast with no added ingredients. Once you
                    start
                    cooking it in oil or adding marinades or sauces, you increase the total calories, carbs and fat.
                    Chicken thigh is slightly more tender and flavorful than chicken breast due to its higher fat
                    content.

                    One skinless, boneless, cooked chicken thigh (52 grams) contains (2):

                    Calories: 109
                    Protein: 13.5 grams
                    Carbs: 0 grams
                    Fat: 5.7 grams
                    A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of chicken thigh provides 209 calories, 26 grams of protein and 10.9
                    grams of
                    fat (2).

                    Thus, 53% of the calories come from protein, while 47% come from fat.

                    Chicken thighs are often cheaper than chicken breasts, making them a good choice for anyone on a
                    budget.
                    When you think about healthy cuts of chicken, chicken wings probably don’t come to mind.

                    However, as long as they’re not covered in breading or sauce and deep-fried, they can easily fit
                    into a
                    healthy diet.

                    One skinless, boneless chicken wing (21 grams) contains (3):

                    Calories: 42.6
                    Protein: 6.4 grams
                    Carbs: 0 grams
                    Fat: 1.7 grams
                    Per 3.5 ounces (100 grams), chicken wings provide 203 calories, 30.5 grams of protein and 8.1 grams
                    of fat
                    (3).

                    This means that 64% of the calories come from protein and 36% from fat.

                <h2 class="text-center">Beef</h2>
                <p>
                    Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been
                    eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.[2]

                    Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as
                    roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak,
                    hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the
                    other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground,
                    minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts
                    that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the
                    reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the
                    heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
                    BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull
                    (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some
                    intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage
                    casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

                    Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for
                    breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for
                    mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam
                    free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation
                    called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of
                    grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

                    Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat
                    production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[5] In absolute numbers,
                    the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest
                    consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed
                    by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93
                    lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world.
                    In comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year,
                    while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per
                    capita.

                    In 2015, the world's largest exporters of beef were India, Brazil and Australia.[6][7] Beef
                    production is also important to the economies of Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico,
                    Belarus and Nicaragua.

                    Beef production has a high environmental impact per gram of protein.[8][9]
                    The word beef is from the Latin bōs,[10] in contrast to cow which is from Middle English cou (both
                    words have the same Indo-European root *gʷou-).[11] After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking
                    nobles who ruled England naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served. Thus,
                    various Anglo-Saxon words were used for the animal (such as nēat, or cu for adult females) by the
                    peasants, but the meat was called boef (ox) (Modern French bœuf) by the French nobles — who did not
                    often deal with the live animal — when it was served to them. This is one example of the common
                    English dichotomy between the words for animals (with largely Germanic origins) and their meat (with
                    Romanic origins) that is also found in such English word-pairs as pig/pork, deer/venison,
                    sheep/mutton and chicken/poultry (also the less common goat/chevon).[12] Beef is cognate with bovine
                    through the Late Latin bovīnus.[13] The rarely used plural form of beef is beeves.
                    People have eaten the flesh of bovines from prehistoric times; some of the earliest known cave
                    paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting scenes. People domesticated cattle
                    around 8000 BC to provide ready access to beef, milk, and leather.[14] Most cattle originated in the
                    Old World, with the exception of bison hybrids, which originated in the Americas. Examples include
                    the Wagyū from Japan, Ankole-Watusi from Egypt, and longhorn Zebu from the Indian subcontinent.[15]

                    It is unknown exactly when people started cooking beef. Cattle were widely used across the Old World
                    as draft animals (oxen), for milk, or specifically for human consumption. With the mechanization of
                    farming, some breeds were specifically bred to increase meat yield, resulting in Chianina and
                    Charolais cattle, or to improve the texture of meat, giving rise to the Murray Grey, Angus, and
                    Wagyū. Some breeds have been selected for both meat and milk production, such as the Brown Swiss
                    (Braunvieh).

                    In the United States, the growth of the beef business was largely due to expansion in the Southwest.
                    Upon the acquisition of grasslands through the Mexican–American War of 1848, and later the expulsion
                    of the Plains Indians from this region and the Midwest, the American livestock industry began,
                    starting primarily with the taming of wild longhorn cattle. Chicago and New York City were the first
                    to benefit from these developments in their stockyards and in their meat markets.[16]

                <p>
                    Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯ̥ɕiꜜ] or [sɯ̥ꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice
                    (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ,
                    neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its
                    presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari
                    (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]

                    Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice
                    or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon,
                    tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled
                    ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes
                    for the dish.

                    Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly
                    sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.[2]
                    Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored
                    in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the
                    fish from spoiling;[3] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early
                    type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi
                    literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し
                    sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall
                    dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty,
                    notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[7]


                    Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
                    Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for
                    the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the
                    rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to
                    be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka,
                    where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood
                    and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.

                    It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori.
                    The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s
                    or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who
                    invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[7] The dish was originally
                    termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term
                    Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its
                    ingredients' origins.[8][9]

                    The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an
                    1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed,
                    or some other flavoring".[10][11] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's
                    Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[12] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal
                    Notes and Queries.[13]
                    Chirashizushi (ちらし寿司, "scattered sushi", also referred to as barazushi) serves the rice in a bowl
                    and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes. It is commonly eaten because it is
                    filling, fast and easy to make.[citation needed] It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March.

                    Edomae chirashizushi (Edo-style scattered sushi) is served with uncooked ingredients in an artful
                    arrangement.
                    Gomokuzushi (Kansai-style sushi) consists of cooked or uncooked ingredients mixed in the body of
                    rice.
                    Sake-zushi (Kyushu-style sushi) uses rice wine over vinegar in preparing the rice, and is topped
                    with shrimp, sea bream, octopus, shiitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots and shredded omelette.
